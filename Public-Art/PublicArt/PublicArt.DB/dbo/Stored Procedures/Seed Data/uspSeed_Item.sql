The inscription ''Water is the ultimate life, pure as crystal, the divine influx'' is attributed to the poet Ted Hughes. The quote does not appear to be from one of Hughes’ poem. A clue may lie with an article entitled ‘Poet, Pike and a Pitiful Grouse’ published in the Guardian newspaper on 8 January 1999. It is an interview Ted Hughes gave to an American angling magazine. In one of the paragraph Hughes reflects on the subject of water: ‘Throughout the whole of religious tradition, rivers have been gods. Water has been the soul. And water is the ultimate life […] In Revelation, it issues from under the throne of God, pure as crystal. The divine influx. Somehow we make that connection. See the Guardian’s website: www.guardian.co.uk/books/1999/jan/08/tedhughes', N'Stainless steel and acrylic', N'''Water is the ultimate life, pure as crystal, the divine influx'' Ted Hughes, etched on the outer rim of the water bowl.', N'In 1997 when the re-development of the Spa started, it was agreed that public art would feature strongly to celebrate the revival of the spa tradition in Bath. The original plan was an ambitious programme of public art called ‘Cascade’, consisting of water features in five to six different locations across the city (see artist impression above). A funding application to the Arts Council reached its final stage with success but within two weeks the funding body was re-structured and funding for the full initial project could no longer be secured. The Arts Council agreed to cover feasibility costs but not production costs. The whole programme was scaled down to one project on Bath Street designed by former Turner Prize finalist Vong Phaophanit. Part of the funding was used to involve schools and the local community in art projects. The second set back came in the form of severe delays in the Spa construction timetable and ensuing spiralling costs, causing concern among local residents. Production cost for Phaophanit’s piece in Bath Street was deemed too expensive and the issue too contentious for B&NES Council to finance. But there was still a strong willingness for a piece of public art to feature at the Spa and a donor was sought to sponsor a less complex piece. A local anonymous donor came forth and artist William Pye was chosen to produce Divine Influx at the Cross Bath.', N'See also William Pye’s Offspring on Walcot Street and Floating Globe on Broad Street Place.', NULL, 290, 100, NULL, 80, N'Good', N'Good', N'Thermae Bath Spa Cross Bath, side of the pool, Bath Street, Bath BA1 1SJ', NULL, 0),

Rather than presume any simple answers, she offers a series of observations open to interpretation. Her imagery moves between Berlin, Bristol, Cornwall, London and the Adriatic, causing you to wonder about the specific location in each image. Ana explores this uncertainty: a sailing boat drifts across a monitor screen, two distant figures walk through a lush park. In her series Found Slides, these places seem unknown even to the artist herself. Ana draws on her own experiences of in-between-ness, of having to move between places geographically, culturally and psychologically, and of living in translation.

Her working processes included combining photography and drawing, temporary site-specific interventions, and exchanges of letters and emails with students, staff and members of the public. She made quiet interventions in which she positioned toys – mainly small construction workers, lorries and diggers around the campus and photographed them as she went.

Sea: in Christian and Jewish imagery water is often a symbol for chaos or disorder in creation. When the Spirit of God is portrayed as brooding "upon the face of the deep" and bringing harmony to confusion in the Genesis creation story, then it is a symbol of the human quest for knowledge in which a university is a crucial part.
Spirit: the Holy Spirit is depicted by many different symbols including fire, wind and a dove. Amongst other things, the imagery of the bird and its wings stands for the freedom - the freedom of God in creation and the freedom of humanity to respond to that divine act of love.
Trinit: at the heart of the triptych is the symbol of the Trinity signifying that God is, of essence, relational.

World Turned Upside Down: a rectangular shaped standing stone with a rounded top. At the top of the panel there is a horse on his back legs holding a thin flag on a stick between his front hooves. Below the horse is the figure of a big man whose arms and legs have been swapped: i.e he has legs for arms and arms for legs. The figure’s face looks disfigured as if the nose had melted. Below the figure’s head there is a pair of legs open in a V shape fitted with boots.  Below there is a pair of arms dropping from the shoulders, with muffled hands, spread to the side at a 30 degree angle. The figure’s body rests on a pair of spread out arms instead of legs. There is a frieze at the bottom with the inscription: ‘World Turned Upside Down From 17th C Image Lansdown. 1643.’
Devastation: a rectangular shaped standing stone with a rounded top. Against a smooth background two villages in flame are carved at the top. The carving in the middle depicts dismembered bodies and horses in a heap, their bodies curling like flames so that the sculpture also brings to mind a bonfire. The lower carving of the sculpture suggests an animal, possibly a bird, holding the falling horses and the dead bodies. Below is a simple frieze and further down the inscription: ‘Devastation From 17th C Image Lansdown. 1643’ is carved.The sculpture appears to be an interpretation of an observer of the battle who said: ‘Legs and arms were flying all over the place.’
Looting Soldier: a rectangular shaped standing stone with a rounded top and a smooth surface in the middle. The carving is of a soldier wearing a hat with strings from which hangs a big fish. He holds a fork in his right hand and a pitchfork in the other. His pockets, attached to his belt, are filled with goods. He holds a shield in his left hand. Underneath there is a frieze and the inscription: ‘Looting Soldier From 17th C Image Lansdown. 1643’
', 2003, 2003, NULL, N'The commission consisted of three three-foot high sculptural panels made from local stone that dealt with issues surrounding the Battle of Lansdown in 1643. The piece highlights the human angle for the ‘common man’ in the war scenario; this is achieved through sculpturally interpreting 17th century contemporary illustrations that addressed the social context of the time, with short letter-cut captions underneath. The traditional letter-cutting and sculptural relief technique were used for accessibility for the partially-sighted, and the piece was made at Spike Island in Bristol in 2003. 
The pieces are adjacent to the blue and orange site markers erected by the Battlefield Trust.

(N'BA186', N'Temptation of Eve', N'A full length carving of Eve, naked, her body leaning against a tree in bloom. Her left arm surrounds the tree, her right arm reaches above her head, palm open, facing the viewer, grabbing the centre of a flower. Above her head are large flowers resembling daisies. Eve’s head is titled to her left, she looks down at her feet that are crossed in front of her. The snake’s head meets Eve’s on her left hand side, as if whispering in her ear. 
The upper part at the back of the statue is decorated with more large flowers. The base of the sculpture is decorated with a fan of feathers that wraps around the base from the back to the front of the sculpture. The feathers at the front of the sculpture, against Eve’s legs, contrast with the curves of her body and echo the flowers’ petals above her head.

Promoter Brian Balls and Bath Festival Organiser John Jukest created a competition for six sculptors from Britain and abroad to carve identical blocks of Bath Stone set up in Victoria Park. This created strong public interest with many people returning day after day to check progress, pass judgment, and give advice and encouragement. The event was funded by the sale of the work afterwards. Masonry apprentices from Bath College volunteered their help.  Extract from Laurence Tindall’s website:www.laurencetindall.co.uk/eve.html

', 2008, NULL, NULL, N'The pictures are made using an old photographic method called cynanotype, invented by Sir John Herschel in 1842. The mathematician and astronomer wanted to produce accurate copies of mathematical formulae that he could not entrust to copyists and this is where the term blueprint comes from. 
The photographs use a range of papers, some from India made from cotton rags coated in simple light sensitive solution. The artist placed the flowers on top and exposed them to sunlight. The indigo blue becomes fixed when rinsing off the solution that remained undeveloped. The process allows for extraordinary detail like a delicate x-ray. The artist added silver leaf or watercolour to create a sense of colour seeping into or leaving the image. Transcript from the exhibition label by Jennie Gilling
